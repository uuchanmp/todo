## Directory layout

This app follows the pub package layout conventions.

`build` - the pre-built example, ready to run in any modern browser. This directory is generated by the build system. Do not modify files in this directory.

`pubspec.yaml` - project metadata and a list of dependencies.

`pubspec.lock` - list of dependencies pinned.

`lib` - Dart code.

`lib/components` - OverReact components.

`web` - the todo app.

## Running the App

Open `build/index.html` in any browser.

## Developing

During development simply run `pub get` then `pub serve` and open Dartium to `localhost:8080`.

To rebuild the app for production run `pub build`.
