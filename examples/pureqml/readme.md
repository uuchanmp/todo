# PureQML TodoMVC Example

> PureQML is a declarative front-end framework aimed to ease complex UI-development (mobile/desktop/SmartTV/etc.). It was originally designed in a platform-agnostic manner. The ultimate goal is to have complete compatibility with original QML by Qt, so, applications developed for Qt QML can be launched in PureQML environment, but due architectural differences between Qt/HTML5/Android/etc., this approach may cause some performance issues, and to avoid that PureQML provides a number of extentions, which allow to achieve a close to native performance. In any case, you can enjoy both portability and performance
